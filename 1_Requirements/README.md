# Requirements

 ## Introduction
 
A windscreen wiper or windshield wiper is a gadget used to eliminate downpour and flotsam and jetsam from a windscreen. Practically all engine vehicle, including trains, airplane and watercraft, are outfitted with such wipers, which are generally a fundamental prerequisite. A wiper for the most part comprises of an arm, turning toward one side and with a long elastic sharp edge connected to the next. The edge is swung to and fro over the glass, pushing water from its surface. The speed is ordinarily customizable, with a few constant paces and frequently at least one "intermittent"settings. Most automobilesuse two synchronized outspread sort arms. It takes a great deal of power to speed up the wiper sharp edges to and fro across the windshield so rapidly. To create this sort of power, a worm gear is utilized on the result of a little electric engine.

The Repositirory gives the tutorial of usig the Qemu Emulator and also STM32 cube IDE.ON and OFF of Ignition by long pressing the blue botton 
and it is indicated by Red light.Blue, Green and Orange LEDs to show the rotation of wiper system and speed of Blinking of led is speed of 
the wiper system, which will be control with Frequency.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to know about the Wiper Control System.There will be one blue colour button on STM32.If we long press it the car 
will start Ignition and Just by Clicking it the Speed can be Change by changing the frequency.

## SOFTWARES
The below tools and packages are needed to work with STM32 Controllers with Qemu Support
* Installable
* GNU Toolchain
* STM Cube IDE
* Xpack Packages
* Windows Build Tools
* Open OCD
* Qemu

## 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW)

## WHAT
The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor (30) that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions. 

## WHEN
The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.

## WHO
A wiper speed control system for an automobile manages the wiper's functioning speed in response to weather conditions

# WHERE
In general, car wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of the steering wheel.

## HOW
You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall
