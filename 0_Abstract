# M3_WiperControlSystem
## Abstract
* Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen.The wipers are now available in the front and back window shields the of cars and many other automobiles.A wiper is made up of a metal arm with one end pivoting and the other end having a long rubber blade attached.The blade is swung back and forth across the glass, removing any water, any precipitation, or other obstructions to view.Nowadays the wiper speed is changeable and also we can give some delay for swung the blade so that it will automatically swung after a period of time.In this project i explain about the wiper control system by using the led,stm32 and arm based microcontroller.

* Wipers play a vitial role in three and four wheelers.It is proven very helpful in rainy,dusty or in mist weather.Driver just have to turn on the wiper button and adjust the speed according to his convenience in order to have a sense of confidence and to have a clear view of the road.In this project I have used STM32F4xx-discovery board to simulate it where we have considered leds as wiper.I have shown speed of the wiper by how fast the led is blinking

* A wiper is a vital component that removes rainfall or any other liquid from the windscreen of a vehicle. The previous method needed manual wiper activation, and raising the wiper was a tough task. As a result, this strategy is suggested as a solution to these problems. The project's purpose is to provide automatic transmission to older cars in order to enhance their systems.
