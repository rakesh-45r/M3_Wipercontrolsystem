# WIPER-CONTROL-SYSTEM

# INTRODUCTION
Wiper is an essential component that is used to wipe raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper.
The STM32F407VG-Discovery board is used to implement a car wiper control system in this project. An electric motor drives the wipers on the windshield. The wiper arms are moved by an electric motor connected to a worm gear that provides the necessary force to a long rod. A wiper is a vital component that removes rainfall or any other liquid from the windscreen of a vehicle. The previous method required manual wiper activation, and raising the wiper was a tough task. As a result, this strategy is suggested as a solution to these problems. The project's purpose is to provide automated transmission to older cars in order to improve their systems. wiping system, to improve the system by adding a sensor and an actuator, and to develop a basic software that would function seamlessly with the framework. The principle of this proposed wiper system is similar to that of other existing conventional wipers.
The Repositirory gives the tutorial of usig the Qemu Emulator and also STM32 cube IDE.ON and OFF of Ignition by long pressing the blue botton 
and it is indicated by Red light.Blue, Green and Orange LEDs to show the rotation of wiper system and speed of Blinking of led is speed of 
the wiper system, which will be control with Frequency.

## COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES:

-> STM32F407 Discovery Board
-> Push Button
-> LEDs
-> Resistors
-> Power Supply

## ADVANTAGES:
-> To save money during wet seasons, turn off the irrigation system. Electricity bills are lowered as a consequence.
-> Rain sensors store water during rain events, allowing it to be available throughout the summer and winter.
-> As a consequence, rain sensor-based equipment like vehicle wipers and irrigation systems last longer since they only work when needed.
-> It is quite simple to use.
-> As a consequence, less energy is consumed.
-> Rain sensor-based systems are extremely simple to install.
-> Individual rain sensors are fairly inexpensive.

## DISADVANTAGES:
-> When water falls squarely on the rain sensor, the mechanism activates.
-> The entire system cost rises when more components, including a rain sensor, are required.
-> Rain sensors must make a decision within a few minutes to avoid erroneous detection of rain.
